v5-protos
=========

The CKEditor 5 prototyping playground.

This repository contains several branches, each dedicated to certain aspects of CKEditor 5. A README.md file should be available on every branch, with further information about its relative feature.

To easily start a new prototype:

```
> sh start-new-prototype BRANCHNAME
```

This is a research place so no production code should be available here.
